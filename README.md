# pia-open-vpn-configs

I don't like using the default PIA (private internet access) osx app, mainly because it's ugly, and out-dated. Instead, I use [Tunnelbick](https://tunnelblick.net) and the PIA OpenVPN configs.

These configs are from https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#twelfth

and packages are based on : https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/osx10.10-openvpn-tunnelblick

`$ brew cask install tunnelbick`

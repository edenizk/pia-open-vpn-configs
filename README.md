# pia-open-vpn-configs

I don't like using the default PIA (private internet access) osx app, mainly because it's ugly, and out-dated. Instead, I use Viscosity [https://www.sparklabs.com/viscosity/] and the PIA OpenVPN configs.

I used to use Tunnelblick, but it causes issues with booting vagrant/virtual box VMs, and their bindings to your en0/en1 mac addresses.

These configs are from https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#twelfth

and packages are based on : https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/osx10.10-viscosity

`$ brew cask install viscosity`
